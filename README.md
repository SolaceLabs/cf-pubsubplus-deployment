## About

This project provides a BOSH 2 manifest for a Solace Messaging deployment.

This project takes advantage of new features such as:

- [cloud config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html)
- [job links](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html)
- [new CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli)
  - The new BOSH CLI must be installed according to the instructions [here](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html).

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

- A deployment of [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh)
- A deployment of [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment), tested on v1.7.0
- Instructions for installing BOSH and Cloud Foundry can be found at http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/.
- A deployment of [Cloud Foundry MySQL](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-deployment)
- Stemcell: ubuntu-trusty, tested on version: "3468.17"
- Compatible Solace BOSH releases: Version 1.4.0+
- Operator resolving BOSH cloud-config
   For correct resource allocation for each vm_type and plan please consult [Solace Pivotal Tile Installation Documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/partners/solace-messaging/installing.html)

### The Solace BOSH Releases

These Solace provided BOSH Releases can be obtained from Solace, or extracted from a Solace Pivotal Tile.
- solace-vmr
- solace-messaging
- docker-bosh, version 30.1.4

Using the Solace Pivotal Tile you can extract the necessary BOSH releases that need to be used for this deployment.

* The Solace Pivotal Evaluation Tile is available for download from [PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/solace-messaging/).
* The Solace Pivotal Enterprise Tile is available by contacting Solace.

Please download or obtain a Solace Pivotal Tile file and keep it around for later use. 

For example, download version 1.4.0 and place it in:

~~~~
cf-solace-messaging-deployment/workspace/solace-messaging-1.4.0.pivotal
~~~~

The Solace Pivotal Tile file is a zip file from which we can extract the required BOSH releases.

Use extract_tile.sh to extract the relevant contents we need.

~~~~
cd workspace
extract_tile.sh -t solace-messaging-1.4.0.pivotal
~~~~

The same can be done using 'unzip':

~~~~
cd workspace
unzip -o -d . solace-messaging-1.4.0.pivotal releases/*.tgz
~~~~

Example of uploading the Solace provided releases to BOSH.
~~~~
bosh upload-release workspace/releases/docker-30.1.4.tgz
bosh upload-release workspace/releases/solace-messaging-1.4.0.tgz
bosh upload-release workspace/releases/solace-vmr-1.4.0.tgz

## Deployment

### Deployment manifest capabilities

The solace-deployment manifest expresses key but not all features of the underlying Solace BOSH releases.

Variable controls are provided for:

| Variable      | Optional | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mysql_plan               | No | MySQL database plan selection. Please consider an HA service for a production deployment. |
| starting_port            | No | The VMR will listen on a range of ports starting from this port number. |
| vmr_admin_password       | No | The 'admin' password for the VMR.  Will set property admin_password |
| solace_vmr_cert          | Yes | The certificate to be used on the VMR for secure connections. Use with [set_solace_vmr_cert.yml](operations/set_solace_vmr_cert.yml), [example](operations/example-vars-files/certs.yml). Can be combined with [disable_service_broker_certificate_validation.yml](operations/disable_service_broker_certificate_validation.yml) if this is a test certificate.  |
| shared_plan_instances    | Yes | The number of VMR instances to create supporting the "shared" plan |
| large_plan_instances     | Yes | The number of VMR instances to create supporting the "large" plan |
| medium_ha_plan_instances | Yes | The number of VMR instances to create supporting the "medium-ha" plan |
| large_ha_plan_instances  | Yes | The number of VMR instances to create supporting the "large-ha" plan |
| community_plan_instances | Yes | The number of VMR instances to create supporting the "community" plan. This will have no effect when using an enterprise solace-vmr release. |

Just keep in mind that any __*plan_instances__ are static, and setting them all Zero means there is no inventory to support the solace-messaging plans.

The manifest contains many properties which are not variable controlled, but may be adjusted if necessary.

| Property      | Optional | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| admin_user          | No | The username of the admin user.  Must be 'admin' in the current version. |
| semp_port           | No | The Port the VMR will use to listen for SEMP requests (administrative operations) |
| semp_ssl_port       | No | The Secure Port the VMR will use to listen for SEMP requests (administrative operations) |
| ssh_port            | No | The Port the VMR will listen onto for direct ssh access to the VMR's CLI |
| vmr_agent_port      | No | The Port the VMR-Agent will listen onto for instructions from service broker |
| syslog_config       | Yes | Syslog configuration |
| tcp_routes_config   | Yes | TCP Routes configuration |
| ldap_config         | Yes | LDAP Configuration |

BOSH operator files provide controls for:

| File      | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [bosh_lite.yml](operations/bosh_lite.yml)              | Downscaling and adjusting key settings to work on bosh-lite |
| [disable_service_broker_open_security_group.yml](operations/disable_service_broker_open_security_group.yml)  | Disable service brokers open access security group ( required to access MySQL service and manage VMRs ) |
| [enable_global_access_to_plans.yml](operations/enable_global_access_to_plans.yml) | Enables global access to solace-messaging service during service broker installation. |
| [use_java_builpack_offline.yml](operations/use_java_builpack_offline.yml) | Using java_builpack_offline for the service broker |
| [google_cloud.yml](operations/google_cloud.yml) | Adjusts manifest vm_types for a google cloud deployment |
| [set_solace_vmr_cert.yml](operations/set_solace_vmr_cert.yml) | Adds a server certificate to the VMR.solace_vmr_cert TLS Configuration. See the example [var file](operations/example-vars-files/certs.yml)  , if no solace_vmr_cert is provided as a property, a self signed certificate will be generate by bosh. |
| [add_vmr_trusted_certs.yml](operations/add_vmr_trusted_certs.yml) | Adds trusted root certificates to the VMR.trusted_root_certificates TLS Configuration. See the example [var file](operations/example-vars-files/certs.yml) There can be several certificates assigned to the solace_trusted_root_cert.certificate property, as shown in that example.
| [disable_service_broker_certificate_validation.yml](operations/disable_service_broker_certificate_validation.yml) | Disables certificate validation on the service broker when it communicates with the VMR. This should only be considered for non production test certificates. |
| [is_enterprise.yml](operations/is_enterprise.yml) | Adjusts the manifest to reflect enterprise VMR settings. Can only be used with an enterprise edition of solace-vmr bosh release containing an enterprise VMR |
| [is_evaluation.yml](operations/is_evaluation.yml) | Adjusts the manifest to reflect evaluation VMR settings. Can only be used with an evaluation edition of solace-vmr bosh release containing an evaluation VMR, which can be downloaded [here](https://network.pivotal.io/products/solace-messaging/). |
| [enable_tcp_routes.yml](operations/enable_tcp_routes.yml) | Adds tcp route configuration, see [tcp_routes_config.yml](operations/example-vars-files/tcp_routes_config.yml) file. 
| [enable_ldap.yml](operations/enable_ldap/yml) | Adds ldap configuration, see this [vars.yml](operations/example-vars-files/ldap_config.yml) file. 
| [set_management_access_ldap.yml](operations/set_management_access_ldap.yml) | Adds ldap authorization for management access. Configuration is found in the same ldap [vars.yml](operations/example-vars-files/ldap_config.yml) file.
| [set_application_access_ldap.yml](operations/set_application_access_ldap.yml) | Adds ldap authorization for application access. 

Only one of these required files can be used and should only be applied as the last operator file, [is_evaluation.yml](operations/is_evaluation.yml) or [is_enterprise.yml](operations/is_enterprise.yml). Please select the one matching your available solace-vmr bosh release.

Sample iaas-support:
- [bosh-lite](iaas-support/bosh-lite/)
- [Openstack](iaas-support/openstack/)
- [GCP](operations/google_cloud.yml)

### Deployment manifest limitations:

While the capabililties of the Solace BOSH releases are well documented in [Solace Pivotal Tile Documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/partners/solace-messaging/),
not all Solace BOSH release capabilities have been fully expressed in this deployment project with samples.
Futures releases of this deployment project will address these capabilities:

- No VMR Trusted Root Certs Config
- No Syslog Config

### How to deploy

Assuming the operator has resolved all [prerequisites](#prerequisites), just use the bosh cli to deploy.

This is a sample of a deployment of an evaluation edition of Solace Message on bosh-lite with self-signed bosh generated vmr certificates, the deployment is named 'solace_messaging', it depends on 'cf' deployment.
